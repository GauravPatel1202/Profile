Innovative technologies are regularly introduced to satisfy the rising demands of companies and users.The challange is to, choose the proper programming language for a wares. All enterprise companites choose a Tech stack whish could be a programming languages, tools and frameworks that the developers use to form web and mobile applications. Hence, it's essential to investigate various relevant factors before you select it. Enterprises today are looking to create robust ,highly scalable and highly available applications must invest in technologies that are powerful enough to dynamically handle big traffic at ease. </p>\n<p>  JavaScript is a top contender for widely used programming languages. The ablility of JavaScript to be used booth in client-side and Server Side programming laugnauge is a big advantage. We can build web applications which works well across various browsers, platforms, and devices by combining JavaScript with markup languages and api's </p>\n<p>  Let us discuss those factors that keep JS in demand.  </p>\n<p> Full-stack development  </p>\n<p>Initially, JavaScript was introduced as a front-end interpreted language. the arrival of full-stack development has made it possible to build backend and front-end code in JavaScript. for instance, Node may be a JS framework that permits you to unify the online development process within one programing language. Few popular full-stack JavaScript is that the MERN(MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS), MEVN(MongoDB, Express, Vue, and NodeJS) ,MEAN stack which is an acronym for MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and NodeJS. Companies like LinkedIn, Netflix, eBay, etc. have taken advantage of this technology. JAMStack is concentrated on the front-end build and delivery and therefore the front and rear of an internet application. </p>\n<p> High-speed advantage  </p>\n<p>JavaScript runs exceptionally fast within the client-side browser. It is unrestricted by network calls to the backend server. Because of the server-side processing, JavaScript enables you to render animation and similar features quickly and ensures a smoother experience for the user.Also, major browsers all support JIT (just in time) compilation for JavaScript, meaning that there's no need to compile the code before running it. </p>\n<p> Ease of testing and debugging  </p>\n<p>Since JavaScript is an interpreted language, it is pretty simple to identify the bugs during run time. The codes are interpreted line by line and errors can be identified along with the line number. Thus, it is easy for the developers to find out fault, debug it, and test it again. </p>\n<p> Event-based language  </p>\n<p>JavaScript is an event-based language, which means the code segments are executed depending on the user activity. To put it, a code segment will be executed only when the user clicks a button or moves the mouse. Here, the advantage is all the codes don’t get initialized when the website is loaded which, in turn, minimizes the loading time. </p>\n<p> Rich interfaces   </p>\n<p>JS frameworks allow you to create feature-rich, captivating search interfaces for your users. Features like drag and drop components, slides, etc. are effortlessly possible with JavaScript.  </p>\n<p>Procedural capabilities  </p>\n<p>JavaScript offers all the features of a procedural programming language. It is possible to execute features like condition checking, looping, forking, and branching, on a web page in JS. All these features make the application interactive and fun to use.  </p>\n<p>Concurrent codes </p>\n<p>Concurrency is the ability to run multiple tasks at a time. In JavaScript, it is possible to handle various operations in a thread by executing functions like Callback, Promises, Async/Await, etc. This, in turn, saves time for developers by not having to write additional programs for various applications.  </p>\n<p>Cost-efficiency  </p>\n<p>The price of developing a software solution incurs huge capital and is a significant investiture, especially when it is a start-up or SME. That is where JavaScript framework can be of great help. Projects that require Many hours of coding can be rapidly build using JavaScript frameworks in minimal time. Most of the JS frameworks are open-source and available for developers for free. Therefore, you don’t have to incur the price of expensive subscriptions or product licenses. The cost of development of the software solution will be significantly low in JavaScript.  </p>\n<p>Security  </p>\n<p>Ensuring the protection of information at priority once it involves building package solutions for businesses. The nice factor concerning JS frameworks is that the lion's share of resources is wired into it for enhancing the protection options and also the intensive support community of developers stays active find out the problems and debugging it proactively. Hence, you'll be able to calculate the protection options offered by this language. </p>\n<p> Futuristic technology  </p>\n<p> Arguably JavaScript is here to remain. The vary to that this programing language has advanced within the last 20 years is unimaginable compared with its competitors. It continues to evolve to suit the ever-changing technological surroundings. hence you'll be able to simply dig out a contemporary, cost effective and sustainable solution in JavaScript for your business. </p>\n<p> To conclude, the selection of technology to make solutions is subjective. It ought to be handpicked supported with use cases, current and future business goals, and affordability. the facility of JavaScript is large, and organizations will leverage it for building glorious mobile and web solutions; but, the ultimate alternative of technology ought to depend upon whether or not it meets the precise needs of the project. </p>"}},"createdAt":"2020-06-08T06:12:06.701Z"},"contentfulSiteInformation":{"siteUrl":"google.com","twiteerHandle":"@muthuks2"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"building-enterprises-ready-solutions-with-javascript"}}}
